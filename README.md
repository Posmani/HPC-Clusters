Repo for the http://www.hpc.ucdavis.edu site.

This site is built by Hugo. To contribute, download and install Hugo, then clone the repo.

Running "hugo" to build the site from the base directory will place the compiled site in the "docs/" directory.

"hugo new content/posts/titleofyourpost.md" will create a new post based on the default archetype, with the
necessary frontmatter. Don't forget to change "draft" to "false" when you're done testing your changes locally before you push
it to the HPC-Clusters repo.
