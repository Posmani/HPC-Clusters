The HPC @ UCDavis team is a core group of staff who specialize in high-performance computing (HPC) 
systems. We are responsible for supercomputing clusters and related resources 
for multiple colleges, departments, and laboratories across the university. 

<!--more-->

We manage multiple clusters and are typically responsible for most or all aspects of the system, including design, 
implementation, maintenance, and administration, though there are some clusters in which we play 
a smaller role. 

**Staff**

* [Bill Broadley](mailto:bill@cse.ucdavis.edu) - System Architect/Technical Lead

* [Tim Thatcher](mailto:tdt@cse.ucdavis.edu) - System Administrator/Support

Our central contact point is the CSE Helpdesk at [help@cse.ucdavis.edu](mailto:help@cse.ucdavis.edu).
