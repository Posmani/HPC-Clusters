We were curious about what other HPC departments looked like at universities across the USA in terms of staffing versus
the amount of hardware managed, so I gathered some information from publicly-available university websites. Here's a chart comparing
them.

**Note:**
 
* This table is intended only as a broad overview of the HPC landscape at various universities. I tried to be as accurate as I could based on what was available online at the sources linked, but my data is only as correct and up-to-date as the information on the websites or as otherwise provided to me. Corrections gratefully accepted.


**Definitions:**

* A **node** is the whole computing machine, including one or more processors, RAM, etc. The node count includes general compute nodes, high-memory nodes, and GPU nodes.
* A **CPU** in this chart means a single processor *core* for general computing. A compute node may have one or more multi-core processors.
* A **GPU** is an entire GPU card - unless the only total I could find is the number of GPU *cores* (CUDA cores) that the cluster claims. The core count of a single GPU card 
can range from hundreds in lower-end cards, up to around 5,700 in a higher-end model, with the average being somewhere in the 2,000 to 3,000 range.
